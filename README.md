## Overview

![Alt text](image.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?<br>
The demo is available in Vercel at [Demo](https://imageuploader-frontend.vercel.app/)

<br>This project was a great opportunity to learn more about the Vite framework, Tailwind CSS and specially consolidate advanced React concepts. I also learned a lot about the FastAPI framework .
- Your wisdom? :)
<br>It's important to have a good understanding of the technologies you are using. I had to spend a lot of time reading the documentation of the frameworks I used, but it was worth it.
